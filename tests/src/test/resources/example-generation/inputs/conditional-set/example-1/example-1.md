Example 1:

Conditional mapping using "set" with a "when" clause that is predicated on the value of a xml element at the specified xml path.

The attribute EngineType->capacityUnit is conditionally set from xml path usEngineType->usEngineSpecification->usEngineDetail->volumeCapacityUnit when the value at xml path a->b->c->d is "FISH".
