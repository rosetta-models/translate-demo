Example 7:

Conditional mapping using "set" with a "when" clause that is predicated on the upstream rosetta path.

- The attribute Z->str3Field is conditionally set from xml element e when the upstream rosetta path is Root->y1Field->zField.
- The attribute Z->str4Field is conditionally set from xml element f when the upstream rosetta path is Root->y2Field->zField.
