Conditional mapping using "set" with a "when" clause that is predicated on the value of a xml element at the specified xml path with multi-cardinality and meta.

The attribute EngineSpecification->fuelType is conditional set from xml path engineType->engineDetail->combustible->scheme when the combustibleScheme = petrolScheme
